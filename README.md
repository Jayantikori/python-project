Analysis and exploring iris dataset with 4 features and 50 samples

# Aim:-
To classify iris flowers among three species (Setosa, Versicolor ,Virginica) from sepals(Length & Width) and petals(Length & Width) measurements.

# Objective:-
To model the probabilities of class membership, conditioned on the flower features. 

# Methodology:-
1)	Load the data - I have collected the iris_dataset from Kaggle.
2)	Analyze and visualize the dataset – I have done the data visualization by graphical representation of information and data.
3)	Model training – in this vary stage we undergo the use of machine learning algorithm to model.
4)	Model Evaluation – After model development we check the accuracy which produces more accurate results.

# Tools & Technology used:-
1)	Python
2)	Jupyter Notebook
3)	Python libraries: pandas, metaplotlib, sklearn.

# Conclusion:-
We classified the new flower belonging to one of three classes (Setosa, Versicolor and Virginia) using iris data set by applying various data analysis and techniques and using various Python libraries.
